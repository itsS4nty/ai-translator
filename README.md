# AI Translator

This is a translation app that uses artificial intelligence to translate text from one language to another. It is built with a frontend using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and a backend using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Usage

To use the application, simply enter text in the original language into the text box and select the language you want to translate to using the dropdown menu. Then, click the "Translate" button and the translated text will appear in the box below. The translation is powered by artificial intelligence and may not be 100% accurate, but we strive to provide the best possible translation for your needs.
